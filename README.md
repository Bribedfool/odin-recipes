#The Odin Recipe Project

This project will demonstrate my current understanding of HTML structure through a recipe website.

#Initial Idea
My initial plan will be to include an HTML index file which will contain relevant and absolute links. Relevant links will lead to my own recipes while absolute links will refer to external recipes or recipes that I referred to. I also expect to make use of certain HTML elements such as ordered lists and images. I actually already self-host a recipe server which will make the project simpler for me.

I must also be mindful of using git, in terms of when to commit and creating concise commit messages, so that my future self can easily understand my workflow.
