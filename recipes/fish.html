        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            One of the main difficulties of cooking beer battered fish is finding a right 
            balance of breading to fish ratio. This general recipe will produce a light and crispy
            breading. However, if you want the fish to be even lighter or perhaps thicker, then simply
            add less flour/pour more beer (for a lighter breading) or add more flour/pour more beer (for a thicker breading). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure you also set aside at least 30 minutes for the batter to set before coating and frying the fish.
            This is usually to let the flour absorb the moisture (the beer and the egg), so that the mixture of the batter will be evenly
            distributed throughout. Also, make sure that your fish is dry as possible before coating and cooking. Otheriwse, the batter will slide off the fish. 
            One trick to achieve this is to lightly coat the fish with flour.
            Another tidbit is the use of baking powder in this recipe. Baking powder activates and bubbles up
            when it contacts moisture (usually with an acid), as well as also activating when exposed to heat. This allows air bubbles to form in the batter which
            results in a lighter, airy breading.
            <p><em>As a side note, many baking powders are now doubly activated which means it becomes activate when either exposed to an acid or exposed to heat.
