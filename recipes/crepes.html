        <p>Crepes are one of the most versatile dishes because not only can it be a dessert, but also a healthy meal. This recipe only covers how to create crepes, but here are some options for possible fillings:
            <ul>
                <strong>Sweet Crepes</strong>
                <li>Nutella + fruit</li>

                <li>Scrambled egg + Ham</li>
                <li>Cheese + Meat or Vegetables</li>
                <li>Smoked Salmon</li>

            Some things you should know before making this recipe: First of all, make sure you have a non-stick skillet, preferably 9 inch in diameter. The skillet should also have slanted edges which should allow for 
            flipping the crepes. Also be prepared to freeze a stick a butter prior to making this recipe as it may melt quickly while you cook your crepes. This recipe calls for a minimum of
            30 minutes for the batter to rest before cooking, so make sure you either set aside time to wait or make the batter ahead of time. Lastly, don't be afraid of flipping the crepes. It is natural to fail and
            be nervous of messing up, but that's also part of the experience of learning and improving. My tip is to act with confidence, and eventually you will succeed with a perfect flip.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>unbleached all-purpose flour (7.5 oz / 213g / 1.5 cups)</li>
                <li>salt (2 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher / 1 tsp Table)</li>
                <li>sugar (2 tsp)</li>
                <li>eggs (5.3 oz / 150g / 3 large) weighed without shell</li>
                <li>water (8.3 oz / 236g / 1 cup)</li>
                <li>whole or 2% milk (8.5 oz / 242g / 1 cup)</li>
                <li>neutral oil (1.9 oz / 54g / 0.25 cup)</li>
                <li>frozen butter for frying (as necessary)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, salt, and sugar.</li>
            <li>Add three large eggs and 1 cup of water to the mix. Whisk until there are no visible lumps.</li>
            <li>Mix in milk and neutral oil (not olive oil). The mixture should coat the back of a spoon, meaning it should be thin.</li>
            <li>Cover the mixture and let rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, whisk the batter. Use a frozen stick of butter to coat the pan. Let the butter heat up and sizzle under medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Bring the pan to the batter and pour a ladle amount of butter into the pan. Swirl the pan so that the batter is evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Cook until the batter starts to brown around the edges.</li>
            <li>Flip the crepe using a reverse arching motion (down, away, and back towards yourself).</li>
            <li>Cook for another minute or so.</li>
        </ol>
